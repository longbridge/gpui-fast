//! Telling scrolls and offset reads apart from other changes, and deciding
//! whether a frame only scrolled a layer (M4).
//!
//! A wheel scroll mutates a container's offset in place and notifies the view
//! that painted it, which looks like any other change. Here it is noted for
//! the container it moved ([`note_scrolled`]), and reads of an offset through
//! the scroll getters ([`note_offset_read`]) are recorded with what a view
//! read, so that a view whose output depends on an offset is told apart from
//! one that was only built again because it holds a scroll container.
//!
//! The wheel listener's notification of the view holding the container is
//! told apart from any other notification of it by counting both: the view
//! is dirty only through the scroll when it was notified no more often than
//! the wheel scrolled what it holds ([`OwnerWatch`]), and no container
//! inside the layer's content scrolled, which the count cannot tell apart.
