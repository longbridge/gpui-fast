/// operations and a reference count round trip per entity, every frame,
/// though most frames draw the entities the last one did. A window's
/// invalidator never changes and an entity's entry for the window exists
/// exactly while the window tracks it (only this function, the release of
/// the entity and the window's removal change either), so only entities that
/// left the set lose it, and only those that entered gain it. Each entity
/// drawn still makes the window its current window, as upstream's loop did.
