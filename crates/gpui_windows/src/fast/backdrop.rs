//! `WindowBackgroundAppearance::Blurred` as Windows 11's own acrylic.
//!
//! Upstream blurs through the accent policy of `SetWindowCompositionAttribute`,
//! an undocumented Windows 10 API. It blurs what is behind the window but adds
//! none of acrylic's tint, luminosity or noise, so content drawn over it reads
//! only where whatever is behind the window happens to contrast with it: dark
//! text over a dark window behind disappears. Windows 11 22H2 (build 22621)
//! documents acrylic as a system backdrop, `DWMSBT_TRANSIENTWINDOW`, the
//! material its own menus and flyouts use, tinted for the light or dark theme.
//! Builds before it keep upstream's accent policy.
//!
//! A system backdrop stays on the window until something replaces it, so the
//! appearances that draw none (`Opaque`, `Transparent`) put it back to
//! `DWMSBT_AUTO`, the default. That also removes a Mica backdrop the window
//! had before, which upstream leaves in place.
