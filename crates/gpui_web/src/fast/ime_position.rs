//! Where the browser opens its IME candidate panel.
//!
//! A browser anchors the panel of a composition (the candidate list of a CJK
//! input method, the accent picker) to the caret of the focused editable
//! element. For GPUI that element is the hidden `<textarea>` of
//! `ime_mirror`, which sits in the page's top left corner, so every panel
//! opened there rather than at the text being composed.
//!
//! So when a composition starts, and as it goes on, the web platform asks the
//! window's input handler where the composed text is and moves the element
//! there, before the browser places the panel. That is what Windows does on
//! `WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION`, and it needs nothing from the application: an
//! input does not have to call `Window::invalidate_character_coordinates`,
//! which costs a frame. `PlatformWindow::update_ime_position`, the push an
//! editor makes with that call, moves the element too.
